GENERAL
- Consumables/Spells are now both considered Utilities.
- Don't show UI for current utilities. Show potions/books(spells) on the characters waist (Q slot on left, E slot on right)

WeaponInventory
- Add left/right button functionality equipping weapons to respective hand

Two-Hand Functionality
- Remove changing from 1h to 2h
- Set some weapons as two handed (i think i added size checks for sheathing already)

EQUIPMENT SYSTEM REVAMP
- Remove Equipment slots UI page
- Add Inventory submenus (All, Weapons, Armour, Utilities)
- Press items to equip/unequip rather than redirect to equipment screen
- While in inventory, if area loot in range, show right window of available loot
- When equiping a weapon, check if main hand is available, if not, fill offhand slot
- Utility slots are handled like equipping weapons

Camera
- Forward momentum is currently tied to camera direction (if looking down, speed will be zero)
- Fix crosshair camera pointing to interactable objects

Enemy
- Ragdoll working for Enemy
- Not currently working for Player

Pickups
- Make pickups depend on crosshair location rather than player location/rotation

Equipment
- Make sure all versions of an item have the same rotation/position (update handslots accoringly)

---------- DOWN IS OLD --------------
Interactable & item popups
	interactable objects should have their own world canvas containing the interactable popup text
	item popups might be changed to a periodically appearing world canvas where the item was picked up

Shields
	cannot parry with left shield yet

Camera
	small bug with camera zoom when camera collides with wall
	you wont be able to scroll out further, but inputmanager.mousescrollY will still increment
	this means that when you stop colliding the camera with the wall,
	you will have to keep scrolling in until it catches back up to the appropriate amount before, 
	the camera moves again

UI
	Create a UIManagerScreen
	Create a UIManagerWorld
	They will contain an update function for everything rather than having loads of them
	(maybe only UIManager is enough)

MOVEMENT
	Remove stamina? Just a hinderance?
	Allow jumping to move player box rather than just player sprite
