GENERAL
- Consumables/Spells are now both considered Utilities.
- Don't show UI for current utilities. Show potions/books(spells) on the characters waist (Q slot on left, E slot on right)

EQUIPMENT SYSTEM REVAMP
- Remove Equipment slots UI page
- Add Inventory submenus (All, Weapons, Armour, Utilities)
- Press items to equip/unequip rather than redirect to equipment screen
- While in inventory, if area loot in range, show right window of available loot
- When equiping a weapon, check if main hand is available, if not, fill offhand slot
- Utility slots are handled like equipping weapons


---------- DOWN IS OLD --------------

Player HUD
	remove bottom right weapon ui
	move bottom right item ui to eqiupment tab

Interactable & item popups
	interactable objects should have their own world canvas containing the interactable popup text
	item popups might be changed to a periodically appearing world canvas where the item was picked up

Ragdoll
	ragdoll is still fucked when an enemy dies

Shields
	cannot parry with left shield yet

Camera
	small bug with camera zoom when camera collides with wall
	you wont be able to scroll out further, but inputmanager.mousescrollY will still increment
	this means that when you stop colliding the camera with the wall,
	you will have to keep scrolling in until it catches back up to the appropriate amount before, 
	the camera moves again

UI
	Create a UIManagerScreen
	Create a UIManagerWorld
	They will contain an update function for everything rather than having loads of them
	(maybe only UIManager is enough)

MOVEMENT
	Remove stamina?
	Allow jumping to move player box rather than just player sprite
